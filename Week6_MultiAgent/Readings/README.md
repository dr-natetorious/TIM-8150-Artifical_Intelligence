> This paper discusses the differences between human and artificial intelligence and the effort that it will take the latter to catch the former.

## Application of Cellular Automates in Some Models of AI (2018)

O. S. Makarenko and V. M. Osaulenko, "Application of Cellular Automates in Some Models of Artificial Intelligence," 2018 IEEE First International Conference on System Analysis & Intelligent Computing (SAIC), Kiev, 2018, pp. 1-4, doi: 10.1109/SAIC.2018.8516837. [CellularAutomates.pdf](CellularAutomates.pdf).

> The modeling of the human brain by using cellular automata concepts is discussed in this paper. An interesting aspect of the presentation is the consideration of scaling from individual entities to large-scale population interactions.

> This paper discusses the characteristics of intelligent agents and the software the implements them and how it differs from other AI technologies.

## Introduction & overview of "artificial life" evolving intelligent agents for modeling & simulation (1996)

Wildberger AM. Introduction & overview of “artificial life” evolving intelligent agents for modeling & simulation. Proceedings Winter Simulation Conference, Simulation Conference, 1996 Proceedings Winter. January 1996:161-168. doi:10.1109/WSC.1996.873274. [EvolvingAgents.pdf](EvolvingAgents.pdf).

## Multi-level agent-based modeling (2013)

aIRD, U. M. I. (2013). Multi-level agent-based modeling: a generic approach and an implementation. Advanced Methods and Technologies for Agent and Multi-Agent Systems, 252, 91, edited by D. Barbucha, et al., IOS Press, 2013. [ProQuest](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ncent-ebooks/detail.action?docID=1441798#?). [ebook_MultiLevelAgentBasedModeling.pdf](ebook_MultiLevelAgentBasedModeling.pdf).

> A generic and operational multi-level agent-based modeling is proposed in this paper. Multiple levels of representation are supported along with morphogenesis operations that allow agents to change.
