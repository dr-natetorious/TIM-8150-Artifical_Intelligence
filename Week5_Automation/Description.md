# Process and Task Automation

This week is devoted to key elements of robotics with a focus on automating processes and tasks. While robotics might bring to mind Terminator-style intelligent robots, the current state of affairs is better represented with examples like autonomous vehicles, automatic crop harvesting, and automated order fulfillment. See the Amazon Robotics link in your weekly resources.

While mobile robots have been used for materials handling operations in manufacturing systems, today's smart manufacturing systems are expected to meet the challenges of mass customization and changing customer demands. This can be achieved by integrating intelligent machines with devices and logistics to expedite the processes required for the success of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) Whether it is an autonomous machine for rescue, toxic waste cleanup, planetary exploration or simply an autonomous vehicle for individual and mass transportation operational frameworks need to integrate existing industrial networks, with robotics operating systems, algorithms, middleware, communication architectures, and data processing.

The complexity of the endeavor can be daunting as a multitude of disciplines and technologies are required, including but not limited to radar technology, cameras, GPS, sonars, image recognition software, AI algorithms like deep reinforcement learning, governments, policymakers, regulators and the public. While most of these technologies existed for a long time, it is only recently that AI was able to provide powerful solutions to the challenges enabling the development of effective prototypes.
