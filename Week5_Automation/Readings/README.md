## Agency Plus Automation (2019)

Heer, J. J. (2019). Agency plus automation: Designing artificial intelligence into interactive systems. PNAS Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 116(6), 1844–1850. [DOI](https://doi-org.proxy1.ncu.edu/10.1073/pnas.1807184115). [AgencyAutomation.pdf](AgencyAutomation.pdf).

> Three case studies of interactive systems are discussed in this paper that integrates proactive support into the system to support learning and improve outcomes.

The field of `Human Computer Interactions (HCI)` led to innovations, such as GUI (Graphical User Interfaces) and the mouse.  In parallel, AI solves many tedious tasks that humans must adhere to.  However, there are several challenges giving all of the control over to the machines such as:

1. Loss of domain expertise (aka use-it-or-lose-it skills)
2. Loss of error handling during catastrophic failure (e.g., plane crashing)
3. Loss of explainability (e.g., why did it do that)

Instead of taking full control of the system, the authors propose using AI to augment and enhance existing human capabilities.  For example, writing an email a `human task` versus grammar checking is an AI enhancement.  These situations appear across numerous other situtations.

### Can you summarize the Data Wrangler example

When data scientist perform ML tasks, 80% of the time goes into curation tasks not specalization tasks.  The Data Wranger Application (DWA) seeks to improve this time distribution by augmenting human capabilities with `predictive AI`.

1. Smart Transformation Hints. While there are an unlimited number of cleaning steps, there are a finite number of _likely actions_.  This asymmetry enables the system to provide "smart hints" on each row and column, then follow up with "action scripts" to apply those mutations.

2. Auto visualization.  Exploring an unknown dataset is another tedious area where machines can look at row and column distributions to surface intelligent graphics.

3. Natural language processing.  Systems that are capable of translating a pile of data into human ready summaries is an open problem that fuels inventments into multi-billion dollar industries.

## Artificial Intelligence(AI), Automation, and its Impact on Data Science (2017)

R. Boire, "Artificial intelligence(AI), automation, and its impact on data science," 2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), Boston, MA, 2017, pp. 3571-3574, [DOI](https://doi-org.proxy1.ncu.edu/10.1109/BigData.2017.8258349). [ImpactOnDataScience.pdf](ImpactOnDataScience.pdf).

> This paper discusses how data science addresses business needs through the transformation AI enabled.

Today (in 2017), data scientist spend less time doing technical hard-skill operations than they did 10 years ago (in 2007).  Looking forward (in 2027), the requirement for these deep technical skills will be even less due to the augmentation of machine learning. So, what does that mean for data scientistic?

The transformation toward a focus on soft-skills and hybrid-skills will be the key differentation of _should I employee a person_ versus _should I buy a system_.  Ex: machine can automate large portions of analysis already using point and click interfaces.  Factor in the ubiquitous availability of commodity cloud computing, and it becomes more economical to bruteforce those clicks, than pay someone to do the task.  However, during this area humans will likely still dominate machines at `applying the results to the business case`.  That action is highly subjective and requires an abstract context that is challenging to replicate.

Though as we look further ahead (in 2037), perhaps that's no longer true, and machines do surpass us.  Until then the value-differentiation is and will continue to be the soft-skills, that lightly touches into the technical relm.
