# Discuss Threats and Challenges of AI in Business and Society

## Instructions

For this assignment, you must write a paper that discusses the ethical implications of AI in organizations and society at large. Consider their main challenges with respect to fairness and security and the result of exploiting the capabilities of AI for harm. Make sure you provide a definition of fairness and how it should be applied to machines that make decisions based on user experience, cultural, social, legal, and ethical tradeoffs.

You should provide examples of AI technologies in your paper that adhere to the previous considerations. For example:

- how would an AI system that makes approval recommendations for loans fairly treat different social groups and individuals?
- How will AI define the boundaries of a group and how will decide if a group is disadvantaged and special considerations should be made? How can the developers of AI systems ensure their systems are inclusive and “respectful” of diversity?
- How can potential conscious and unconscious human biases be eliminated from training sets and models so that predictions are reliable, and decisions are objective and fair?

## Requirements

Length: 5-7 page paper, not including title or reference pages
