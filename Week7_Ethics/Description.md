# The Ethical and Social Implications of Artificial Intelligence

AI has revolutionized the work and social environments by introducing technologies that automate processes like language translation, object identification, solution optimization, etc. While this growth has been, in general, welcomed the asymmetrical development, and use of the technology poses threats to the protection and rights of people, organizations, and social groups.

The opportunities for AI in industries like transportation, healthcare, and education at times seem limitless, but they often raise questions about fairness, privacy, and security among others. The risk is that the degree of fairness can be manipulated to serve politics and practices that discriminate and marginalize. Advancing AI technologies and embedding them in your life requires that you enforce inclusiveness and eliminate bias and unfair outcomes.

Some of the AI technologies we show in this course (like machine language) are based on learning from training data and making predictions on test data. This learning process can oftentimes include sensitive data (like patient history) that could have potential privacy implications. Consider the individualâ€™s expectation about confidentiality and privacy and respecting the social norms can be as important as complying with legal and regulatory requirements.

Modern and future AI systems would be able to go beyond what you know and provide solutions and make discoveries beyond your experience and comprehension. This will come at a cost as you will be unable in many cases (like deep neural networks) to quantify and understand how a result was observed. Delegating intelligence to machines might challenge our comfort levels by delegating control of our lives.
