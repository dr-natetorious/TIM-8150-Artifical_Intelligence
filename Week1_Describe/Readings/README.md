> This paper provides a brief history of AI introducing basic concepts and principles.

The voyage toward AI has been a long journey.  During the early 1900s models attempted to reproduce human intelligence.  The defacto platform was to build solvers for chess, which reached the point of DeepBlue beating the chessmaster in 1997.  Along the way solvers began with heuristics that would reduce the trial-and-error search space.  Creating new and innovative heuristics became the state of the art solution deep into the 1960s.

> The most central idea of the pre-1962 period was that of finding heuristic devices to control
the breadth of a trial-and-error search. A close second preoccupation was with finding effective techniques for learning. In the post-1962 era the concern became less with "learning" and more with the problem of representation of knowledge (however acquired) and with the related problem of breaking through the formality and narrowness of the older systems. The problem of heuristic search efficiency remains as an underlying constraint, but it is no longer the problem one thinks about, for we are now
immersed in more sophisticated subproblems, e.g., the representation and modification of plans" (Minsky 1968, p. 9).

Another common challenge was text parsing and translation.  Original approaches would use large dictionaries and do literal term replacements, however, these results were laughable and broadly defunded.  Modern methods extract both the raw phrases and the conversational context.

In the middle were various programming languages (e.g., LISP) to address these challenges.  These systems generally follow an algebraic solver approach.  While primative by modern standards, it was possible to defeat humans at board games.  Others researchers found success with rule based models that would even introduce erroneous decisions to more closely mimic humans.

> This paper provides an overview of modern AI

The short article covers the people that innovated across various sciences to produce artificial intelligence. These efforts began in ancient Greece with the ideas coming to fruition around the 1930s through formalization of mathmatical models.

Artificial intelligence comes in four categories:

- Systems that think like humans;
- Systems that act like humans;
- Systems that think rationally;
- Systems that act rationally.

## Demystifying AI: What Digital Transformation Leaders Can Teach You about Realistic Artificial Intelligence (2019)

Brock, J. K.-U., & von Wangenheim, F. (2019). Demystifying AI: What Digital Transformation Leaders Can Teach You about Realistic Artificial Intelligence. California Management Review, 61(4), 110–134. [DOI](https://doi-org.proxy1.ncu.edu/10.1177/1536504219865226). [Demystifying.pdf](Demystifying.pdf).

> In the context of digital transformation, a framework for successfully implementing AI is presented in this paper.

For every success story deploying machine learning; there are dozens of failures.  The authors collected survey results from senior managers and review the responses.  When reviewing the leaders and laggers the biggest difference was leadership and preparation.  They created the DIGITAL mnemonic to weed out these challenges upfront and improve the probability of success.
