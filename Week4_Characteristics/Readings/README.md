[ClassificationEconomics.pdf](ClassificationEconomics.pdf)

> This paper describes machine learning methods for the determination of business cycle turning points.

The authors compare the accuracy of both K-NN (Nearest neighbors) and NN (Neural network) to classify business cycles, which are either expansive or regressive in nature.  They also use a `Kalman Filter` to smooth out noise within the time series data.  One of the challenges they needed to overcome is `comovement` as that causes inter-relations between the variables and skews results.  Using `Dynamic Factor Markov-Switching` addresses this issue by modeling volatility more efficiently than standard models.
